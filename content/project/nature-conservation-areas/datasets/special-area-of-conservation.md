Special areas of conservation are high-quality conservation sites that are protected, because they will make a significant contribution to conserving habitats and species.

We have not yet started exploring this area, but we are aware that Natural England have published an [existing dataset on special areas of conservation in England](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/a85e64d9-d0f1-4500-9080-b0e29b81fbc8/special-areas-of-conservation-england).
