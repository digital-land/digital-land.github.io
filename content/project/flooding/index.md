We collect and publish data on planning policies and decisions. One dataset we want to explore is flood zones.

Flood zones rate an area based on the probability of that area flooding, from 1 (least likely to flood) to 3 (more likely to flood).

We have not yet started exploring this area, but we are aware that the Environment Agency have published an existing dataset on [Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea) - Flood Zone 2](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cf494c44-05cd-4060-a029-35937970c9c6/flood-map-for-planning-rivers-and-sea-flood-zone-2)
