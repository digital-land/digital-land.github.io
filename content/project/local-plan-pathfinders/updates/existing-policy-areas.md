We're keen to understand from local planning authorities which policy areas are key to their local plan. As a starting point we've identified some of the [existing policy areas](list-of-existing-policy-areas) that we think might be interesting to explore.

This list isn't exhaustive and some of the areas may not apply or be considered important to all local planning authorities.
