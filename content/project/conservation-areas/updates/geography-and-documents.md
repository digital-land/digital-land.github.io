Whilst collecting extra data for Lambeth and Southwark we learnt that often there is more than 1 document related to the conservation area. We decided a conservation area, as data, is best represented by a [geography](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/geography/), to describe the area, and a list of related [documents](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/document/).
