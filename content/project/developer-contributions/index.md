We collect and publish data on planning policies and decisions. One national dataset that we’ve started to collect is developer contributions.

We collect data from local authorities who have published data that matches the data standard outlined in [the developer contribution guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publish-your-developer-contributions-data).
