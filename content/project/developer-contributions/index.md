We collect and publish data on planning policies and decisions. One national dataset that weâ€™ve started to collect is developer contributions.

We collect data from local authorities who have published data that matches the data standard outlined in [the developer contribution guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publish-your-developer-contributions-data).
