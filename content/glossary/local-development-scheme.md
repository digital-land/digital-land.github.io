Local development schemes are public 'project plans' which identify which local development documents will be produced, in what order and when. It became a statutory requirement for local planning authorities in the UK to produce these schemes under the [Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004] (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/contents).

The local development scheme acts as the starting point for the community and stakeholders to find out about the local authority's planning policies in respect to a particular place or issue, and what the status of those policies is. It also outlines the details of, and timetable for the production of all documents that make up the local development framework over a three-year period.
