* Are often on disused or derelict land.
* Are more available in the North and Midlands (but most housing demand is in the south east).
* Are valuable as existing buildings can be split up into more homes on any one site.
* The site has already been developed so reduces urban sprawl.
* Use unsightly areas for building developments, so improves the urban environment.
* Are found in urban areas, so building housing there reduces demand on car use.
* Are more expensive to build on as often the land needs to be cleared first (especially if land is contaminated from previous industrial use).
