[Energy Performance Certificates] (https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates) (EPCs) are needed whenever a property is:

* built
* sold
* rented

You must order an EPC for potential buyers and tenants before you market your property to sell or rent.

An EPC contains:

* information about a propertyâ€™s energy use and typical energy costs
* recommendations about how to reduce energy use and save money

An EPC gives a property an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient) and is valid for 10 years.
