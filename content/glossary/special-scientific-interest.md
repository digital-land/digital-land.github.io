A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a formal conservation designation for an area which is of particular interest because of its fauna, flora or geological or physiological features.

Local authorities are required to have policies within their [local plan] (/glossary/local-plan/) to protect SSSIs, and should a planning application be submitted either on or close to the site then the appropriate conversation body must be consulted.

Orginally established in the [National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949] (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/97). SSSIs legal status was later updated in 2000 through the [Countryside and Rights of Way Act] (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/contents). SSSIs are also covered in the [Water Resources Act 1991] (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/57/contents).
