Sites of archaeological or historic importance are protected by the [Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979] (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46) and are listed on the [National Heritage List for England] (https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/). This gives them legally protected status.

In order to carry out any work to a scheduled ancient monument or site you will need to apply to Historic England for a [Scheduled Monument Consent] (https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc/).
