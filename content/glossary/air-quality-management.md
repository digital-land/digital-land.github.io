In an effort to reduce air pollution [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) have set air quality targets for each local authority.

When a local authority identifies an area where they are at risk of not meeting their target they must set an [Air Quality Action Plan] (https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/technical-guidance/).
