summary: We’re working to make it easier for you to publish land and housing data to comply with government legislation.

If you work for a local authority and publish or maintain data on one of the land and housing concerns we’re looking at in [our projects](https://digital-land.github.io/project/), we offer guidance and tools that will help you publish the data more easily and accurately.  These will both help you comply with your duty to publish and ensure the data is consistent and machine readable.

## Our offer to local government
We’re working closely with local government to understand how they work and what their resources and constraints are around collecting, publishing and updating data. With their essential input we’re creating guidance that will help them publish data that complies with required data standards, but without adding to their workload. Our guidance on publishing [brownfield site data](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/brownfield-sites/) and [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/developer-contributions/) are 2 examples of this. Before publishing guidance we test it with officers from local government, and continue to improve it based on feedback.

We’re also building digital tools to help local government:

- check their data or represent it in different ways, such as our validator tools for [brownfield site data](https://brownfield-sites-validator.herokuapp.com/start) and [developer contributions data](https://section-106-prototype.herokuapp.com/validate-start)
- find other local government’ data, such as our [index of published viability assessments](https://section-106-prototype.herokuapp.com/viability/)
- visualise or represent land and housing data, such as our [developer contributions dashboard](https://section-106-prototype.herokuapp.com/developer-contributions/section106-wide) or our tool for [creating a Section 106 summary](https://section-106-prototype.herokuapp.com/create-section106)
- see how publishing reliable and trustworthy data that’s easy to find and use can add value

Take a look at these tools and let us know how we can improve them by joining the discussion on our [issues pages](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues).
