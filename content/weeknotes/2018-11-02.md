A quiet team week with just two of us in the office. Adam continued to iterate the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) and we revisited the collector for continuous validation. Paul joined [Linda](https://twitter.com/LindaSasta) for a workshop at [Future Cities Catapult](https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/) on opportunities to work together, in particular with users of standards developed by Digital Land Services.

We showed more work on collecting concerns, progress on developer contributions, and testing the brownfield sites registers with policy and local authority users.
