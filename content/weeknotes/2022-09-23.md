This was the original website for the DLUHC Planning Data team, previously known as the Digital Land team.

Our platform is now in public beta and has a new site: [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/)

Data and information about our work has moved to the new site, we no longer regularly update this website but you can still read our old weeknotes and blogs. 

Working in the open has always been one of our team values and we will return to blogging and writing weeknotes in the near future, until then you can follow [Digital Planning on twitter](https://twitter.com/DigiPlanningGov).

For our current work and planning data, visit [planning.data.gov.uk](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/).
