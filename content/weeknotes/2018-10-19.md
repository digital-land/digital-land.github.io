The team visited the excellent [Living with Buildings exhibition](https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/Wk4sPSQAACcANwrX) ahead of retrospective and [roadmapping](http://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap) sessions in Camden. We were particularly surprised by the invective [Charles Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Booth_(social_reformer)) used on his poverty maps.

Following a meeting with one of the brownfield policy team we’ve done some further work on the validator to [plot the results of the validated data onto a map](https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-sites/results/map/). There’s a bit more work we can do, but it’s something that we’re eager to take out and test.

We meet with [Leigh Dodds](https://twitter.com/ldodds) from the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) (ODI) and ran a workshop to map out the relationship of people, documents and data within the planning ecosystem. It was a useful exercise and helped us think about connects between people/task and data from a different angle.

We showed some progress on the [digital land website](https://digital-land.github.io/) site, including adding [events](/event) and [blog posts](/blog-post) pages. Colm and Adam demonstrated an experimental [map of validation results](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/results/map).
