On Tuesday Paul joined a panel at the ODI summit to talk about how local governments can take advantage of the opportunities created by data to improve public services and better serve communities.

On the [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions) project we met with the GLA, Southwark and TFL to discuss the user needs and data model. It was encouraging to hear that we’re all on the same page with regards to the data we’d like to publish. We also talked through some of the challenges that we’ve identified, and agreed some useful next steps to work on these collaboratively.

We’ve started prototyping a [dashboard of the developer contribution data](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/developer-contributions/section106-wide), at the moment it uses some test data, we’ll be feeding in some real data over the course of the next few weeks.
