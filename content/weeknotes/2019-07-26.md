This week we held the local plans steering group to present the findings from Paul B and Helena's discovery work to our internal stakeholders. The work was positively recieved and we're now planning the next steps of the project as we prepare to move into alpha.

Matt has continued his work on Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) and has plans for a proposed model that will be published on our [CPO project page](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) soon. Lorna is also forming a user research plan for CPOs. If you're interested in this topic, please contact us at [digitalland@communities.gov.uk](mailto:digitalland@communities.gov.uk).

Natalie and Ed have now completed  an introductory pack for our new Minister following the cabinet reshuffle this week. 
The whole team fed back on this during our fortnightly show and tell. Natalie and Ed are also developing a short term programme for our work so that we're closely aligned with the wider departmental strategy.
