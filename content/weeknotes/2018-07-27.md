This week the Digital Land Services team ran their first show and tell where we talked about some of our findings from discovery, and demoed an early view of the ‘brownfield sites validator’ tool. We plan to run future show and tells on a fortnightly basis, and hope to be able to make them publicly available soon.

We continued development work on the [‘brownfield sites validator’](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) which now feeds back whether a given set of data meets the specification, and if not where the problems are. Our next step is to provide a visual representation of the data on a map.

The team also had a rare opportunity to be co-located for a few days, we used this time to run some design sessions, and conduct an end of discovery retrospective.
