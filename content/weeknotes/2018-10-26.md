The team has been working on the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) iterating the data model so we can understand the history of changes to registers. Of the 381 registers we have found 339 published, only 20 meet the standard, 5 with no errors. Over the course of the past two months, 32 have been moved or gone missing. Weâ€™re working on better guidance and tools to help publishers meet the standard.

We also had a quick show-and-tell with the implementation unit before talking about the golden thread recommendation from the [Hackitt review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report).

Paul blogged about the [difficulties of making data from information, and cake](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/25/data-and-information/).
