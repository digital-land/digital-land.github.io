This week the team continued working on [Section 106](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/). We met with [Southwark Council](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/) who told us about the work their team are doing around collecting and publishing Section 106 data.

We’ve also started to build an [online form](https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/create-section106) to collect Section 106 summary and Viability Assessment summary data. We’ll use this to help test the data standard with Local Planning Authorities.
