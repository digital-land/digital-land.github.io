Rose has been recruiting participants to give us insight into how the brownfield registers were made, and if they are working for users. We were joined by [Alex Blandford](https://twitter.com/blangry), who has been helping us start our end-of-discovery report.

We rebuilt our [data collector](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector) and started to collect tree preservation orders and contaminated land datasets published by planning authorities. So far this has meant sending out 120 emails, many of which we learnt, arrived in the inbox of one person working at [Misoportal](https://misoportal.com/)

Next week weâ€™re joined by [Matt Lucht](https://twitter.com/mattlucht), our new delivery manager and later in the week, by Michael Nottingham, our content editor.
