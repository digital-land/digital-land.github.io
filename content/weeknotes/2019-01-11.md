Our team is still growing! This week we welcomed our new User Research [Paul Bermudez](https://twitter.com/pebdesign). Welcome (yet another) Paul!

We progressed the architecture of our work, which feeds into our roadmapping, which we talked through at our show and tell. Thanks to everyone who came!

Paul Downey spoke on a panel at Reading University about planning data. Excitingly, the Digital Land team were being talked about by other speakers before Paul had even introduced our work!

Our [developer contributions consultation](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions) is ongoing until the end of January and weâ€™ve had nearly 400 individual views so far.

We ran our first show and tell of 2019 where the team talked through the early view of the service architecture, our approach for learning about a design process for policy making, and what we've learnt through the early stages of the [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions) public consultation.
