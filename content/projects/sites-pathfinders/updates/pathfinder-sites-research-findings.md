A [definition of sites](https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2021-06-29/) was established after user research sessions with local authorities. The sessions also identified issues with how sites data comes to local authorities in multiple formats including PDFs, handwritten papers and MS Word documents. Those who maintain and monitor sites data donâ€™t have the ability to publish it on a local authority website.
