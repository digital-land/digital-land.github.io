We collect and publish data on planning policies and decisions. One of the main areas we are exploring is development plans. Development plans are documents that contain policies related to planning and development. These can be local plans, neighbourhood plans, area action plans or waste plans.

These documents are a rich source of information. For example, a local plan sets out all local planning policies and decisions for authorities. It identifies how land is used, decides what will be built where and is used to determine all local planning decisions. Every local planning authority is required to update its local plan every 5 years.
