In March 2020 we procured DXW to run an alpha into local plans.

The project tested ideas for the better use of data held within and about local plans. Data within local plans is information contained in a plan, such as the number of houses a local authority plans to build. An example of data about local plans might be an overview of when each local planning authority last published theirs.
