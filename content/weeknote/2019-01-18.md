This week the team had a project kickoff with [MySociety](https://www.mysociety.org) for the [central register of planning applications](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/) work.

Rebecca and Paul attended a Royal Geographical Society lecture on “Creating a Mastermap”. Paul sketched some notes!

The team’s work on [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions) is progressing. Three workshops we have just announced over subscribed within 24 hours! We look forward to meeting with local authority planners at those workshops at the end of January.

We had a great conversation with Max in the local plans team and have started building the [project page](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans) which describes our work.

We have been talking to colleagues in the [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) about how our work areas are linked and we attended a joint show and tell with them on Thursday.
