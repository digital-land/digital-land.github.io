This week we continued further work on the brownfield site validator. You can now see a side-by-side comparison of some of the common errors (ie reversed GeoX and GeoY coordinates). For a number of the common errors we can automatically fix these, and provide the local authority with a valid .csv file that they can re-upload to their site.

We met with the [Greater London Authority](https://www.london.gov.uk/) (GLA) at City Hall. We talked about data standards and how that fits into their London Development Database initiative. Through the meeting with identified a number of areas of common interest, for example establishing a data standard around developer contributions, over the coming weeks we plan to hold join workshops between planning authorities, the GLA and MHCLG.
