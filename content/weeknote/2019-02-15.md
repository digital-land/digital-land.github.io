This week Paul had his first MHCLG Digital Land birthday! It was a good moment to reflect on what we've done so far and where we're heading over the next year.

The team have been working on a [tool to help collect housing numbers data](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/) from within Local Plans. We're working with colleagues in the policy team to identify the correct housing numbers and store them in one place.

Helena and Paul B attended the Future Cities Catapult’s (FCC) workshop about better data in planning, to see the work FCC have done so far and advise on the pros/cons of several options to improve data use in planning going forwards. Helena also presented the vision and work so far of our team at the London LDCU roadshow.

Paul D attended the ‘Big data and the design of cities - Chicago and London’ event at New London Architecture, to talk about how the collection and dissemination of big data is changing how we plan and build cities, and about the future of open data collection and use.
