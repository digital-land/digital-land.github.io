Along with colleagues in the developer contribution policy team we met with one of the 3rd party suppliers of Section 106 management software. It was a productive meeting where we were able to explore possibilites of getting Section 106 data directly from their software in a format that meets our data standard. We'll continue to work together and with other suppliers to test this further.

We’ve continued to work on the [Digital Land website](http://digital-land.github.io). We’ve started to add [project pages](https://digital-land.github.io/project) to help us communicate the things we’re working on. There’s a bit more we need to do in order to get the information architecture right, but it’s getting there
