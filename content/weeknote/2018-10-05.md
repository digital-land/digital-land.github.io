We did some further work on the [brownfield site validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/), this was demoed by Adam in the show and tell on Thursday 4th. We also continued to add content to the [Digital Land website](https://digital-land.github.io), and begun to think about the future information architecture of the site.

We had a very interesting meeting with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) where we talked and demoed our respective work. There are definitely some shared goals between them and us, so over the coming weeks we plan to have a more detailed workshop to agree areas of reuse, and how we can work together.

Paul met [Dacorum Borough Council](http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/) they are interested in what we’re doing, and we hope to work with them to help test our alphas.

Paul also was invited to participate on a panel on “how data can change a marketplace” at the annual Ofgem conference

A joint show and tell with the <a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/category/local-digital-team/">Local Digital Team</a>. We demonstrated the updates to the [brownfield site validation tool](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/) and gave an overview of the proposed information architecture of the [digital land website](https://digital-land.github.io/)
