The Digital Land team investigates ways to make land and housing data easier to find, use and trust so that:

* proptech companies can create digital tools that make it easier to develop, sell, buy or rent
* land/housing developers can comply with regulations and find opportunities to build
* government can create policies and services that work for everyone
