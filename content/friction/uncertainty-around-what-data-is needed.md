title: "Uncertainty around what data is needed"
---

It’s hard to determine what data is needed to make a better planning application. We have asked local authorities for their lists of constraints, but often these are general concerns (e.g. “Gas”) rather than a more precise reference to an authoritative source of information.

It would be difficult to create a service that knows which authority to send a planning application to, let alone which pieces of data are needed to create a strong planning application.

[Local Land Charges]({{< relref "local-land-charge.md" >}}) and [CON29]({{< relref "con29.md" >}}) are similarly difficult for someone outside of the conveyancing profession to determine what information is available, or may be be asked for.
