title: "Data collection is hard to keep up to date"
---

Itâ€™s often hard to write an automatic process to download a dataset:

* URLs change or break
* Some data is made using JavaScript which only works when a human is present
* Many datasets are kept behind email or permissions-walls

These barriers mean collecting and updating datasets published by organisations including Ordnance Survey, Environment Agency, Historic England and many local authorities is a manual process.
