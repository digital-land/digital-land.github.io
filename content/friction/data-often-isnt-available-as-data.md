title: "Data often isn't available as data"

Often even the most basic information often isn’t available as data. For example, every local planning authority should publish a local plan, but there isn’t an authoritative list of local planning authorities, and there isn’t a single list of local plans.

The best public list of local planning authorities we’ve found is a [PDF published by the planning inspectorate] (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714682/Copy_of_LPA_Strategic_Plan_Progress_-_31_May_2018.Gov.UK.pdf), but the data in this is text, which requires effort and care to process. Ideally this would be a register with links to local authorities, development area and national park registers and the local plans themselves.
