title: "Lack of value seen in publishing data"

Some local authorities have seen benefits in publishing open data. Mid-Sussex for example, reported a fall in calls to their call-centre by making tree preservation orders open data.

However many organisations see publishing data is seen as a burden, an externality, with little return on the costs of publication.
