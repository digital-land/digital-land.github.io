title: "Data use is restricted"

Much data is made available under an open government licence, but with additional, restrictive terms.

National [radon data](/glossary/radon), for example, commissioned by the [Health and Safety Executive](/glossary/health-and-safety-executive) is made available “for planning purposes only” and one [brownfield register](/glossary/brownfield-site) publisher explicitly warns against building services which compete with Ordnance Survey.

Such restrictions limit unforseen, innovative use-cases for the data.
