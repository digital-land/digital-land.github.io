      <description>To ensure consistency of data that has been provided from multiple sources, we have established a set of principles that are used across all data sets.
Structuring data Our data models share similar principles of a relational database. This helps to reduce duplication and makes the data easier to maintain, which in turn increases the trust and usefulness of the data.
When modelling the data standard for developer contributions we created 3 files which can be linked together using unique identifiers.</description>

      <title>Pipeline – how we collect and process data</title>

      <description>One of our principles is that data should be maintained as close to the source as possible. This means that we often have to bring together over 350 sources to make one national dataset.
Our “pipeline” describes the steps we take to collect data from each of those sources and transform them into a national dataset.
We support publishers of data by providing guidance and tools to help ensure their data meets the data standard.</description>
