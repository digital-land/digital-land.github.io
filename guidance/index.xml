      <description>The National Planning Policy Framework requires all local planning authorities and certain other organisations to publish their developer contributions data on a regular basis and in an agreed format. That format hasnâ€™t yet been agreed, but the following guidance is a working approach that we plan to refine with your input.
Our aim is to develop a data format and publishing guidance that results in better insights into how developer contributions are supporting community infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Local planning authorities must maintain a register of their brownfield sites that is publicly available and in an agreed format.
This guidance, alongside the Check your brownfield site register service, will help local authorities ensure brownfield site registers are:
 in the agreed format and contain the required data kept up-to-date easily found online  This ensures the data is fit for purpose and meets the needs of planners, developers, policymakers and communities.</description>
