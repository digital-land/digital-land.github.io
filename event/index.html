<h3 id="this-week-at-digital-land-services">This week at Digital Land Services</h3>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27 May 2019</p>

<p>This week Christine has been prototyping the registers editor and Paul D has been revisiting the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openregister/0.8.8/">python open register library</a>. Adam and Colm have been tweaking the housing numbers prototype which is part of our bigger local plans project.</p>

<p>On Tuesday Paul D and Matt visited Bristol to learn more about compulsory purchase orders (CPOs). They met with colleagues from policy, the planning caseworker unit and the Planning Inspectorate. During the workshop they explored the process of raising and managing CPOs and looked at the decision making process. They then looked at the data and discussed how to make it publicly available.</p>

<p>Emily and Michael have been working on some exciting new Digital Land website designs and content. Jake has been integrating a new content management system and building the designs in code â€“ watch this space!</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 20 May 2019</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been a big week for the team as digital services and policy have merged! Ed Culliney and new recruit Natalie Record have joined the team, marking the official joining of Digital Land services with policy â€“ the ultimate multidisciplinary team.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s official! No more separate Digital Land &lsquo;Services&rsquo; and &lsquo;Policy&rsquo; teams &hellip; just one big happy Digital Land team with policy and services working together. Living the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneTeamGov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OneTeamGov</a> dream ðŸ™Œ <a href="https://t.co/tKyRCclJtC">pic.twitter.com/tKyRCclJtC</a></p>&mdash; Rebecca Pye (@becpye) <a href="https://twitter.com/becpye/status/1131241801933832194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Ed, Natalie, Christine and Emily also attended a GDS academy course on agile training for teams. The training was brilliant, involving kanban board games, lean races, and exercises in scrum ways of working. Weâ€™re looking forward to applying our learning in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Paul D presented our vision at the Future City Catapult event, meeting new people from across the industry. Back in the office, Jake and Adam (developers) have been working on some exciting website plans, researching a new CMS which allows everyone in the team to easily publish and maintain content.</p>

<p>Paul B (user researcher) spoke with a council who are collaborating with other neighbouring councils on a Joint Strategic Plan. Paul B and Helena (service designer) also ran a workshop with teams from MHCLGâ€™s housing directorate to understand their needs from local plans. The meeting confirmed some of the initial findings and also shed new light on how the status of local plans is important to different parts of the organisation.</p>

<h4 id="local-plans">Local plans</h4>

<p>This week, Paul (Bermudez) and Helena have been busy working on the tail end of the <a href="/project/local-plans">Local Plans discovery</a>. Their primary focus has been to analyse the insights that they&rsquo;ve gathered so far ahead of an internal steering group next week.</p>

<p>On another aspect of Local Plans, the <a href="/project/housing-numbers">housing numbers</a>, our colleagues on the policy team have collected housing numbers from local plans. The vast majority of Local Planning Authorities have now been accounted for, and Colm and Adam are helping to make some changes to how we capture data for joint plans.</p>

<h4 id="developer-contributions">Developer contributions</h4>

<p>Following the developer contributions workshops and lab testing the team have been analysing the feedback to identify areas where we can make improvements. Emily and Michael have made a number of <a href="/guidance/developer-contributions">changes to the guidance</a> which we hope will address some of the problem areas that we identified.</p>

<h4 id="our-service">Our service</h4>

<p>Paul (Downey) has been working on some story mapping which forms a road map for the service. From this, Jake has been revisiting the work on a validator tool, and Christine has started prototyping a tool for building registers.</p>

<strong>Location:</strong> Digital Land, Ground Floor, Fry Building, London</p>

<p>We ran our first show and tell of 2019 where the team talked through the early view of the service architecture, our approach for learning about a design process for policy making, and what we&rsquo;ve learnt through the early stages of the <a href="/project/developer-contributions">developer contributions</a> public consultation.</p>
