      <description>Resources for planning authorities Update your brownfield site data: guidance for local planning authorities Follow these simple instructions when adding new brownfield sites to their registers.
Check brownfield site data for errors Our validator will check local planning authorities&amp;rsquo; brownfield site data for common errors and omissions and fix them. A comparison of data quality for brownfield registers that have been checked is also available.

      <description>Upcoming areas of investigation We plan to explore the following by prototyping tools and by testing and consulting with people involved with developer contributions, and responding to your feedback.
We will regularly add updates to the following issues on GitHub:
 Timeline 11 July 2019
We met with colleagues from the Knowledge and Information Management team to understand the steps we need to take to publish decision letters and inspector reports.</description>

      <description>Help us develop a common data format In the alpha phase of this project, we developed a new common standard for publishing data on developer contributions.
We are proposing a simple data format for developer contributions that:
 meets the user needs we’ve identified requires minimal effort from local planning authorities to create and make the data available  You can help us improve the format by:
 joining the discussion on our GitHub issues making comments using our feedback form following the proposed guidance next time you publish your developer contributions  We will continue to develop the format as we learn from testing the format with data and the prototypes with users.</description>

      <title>Energy performance of buildings</title>

      <description>Finding an energy certificate or an energy assessor for a building is now easier thanks to a new online service. A prototype being developed by the energy performance of buildings (EPB) team within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Digital Directorate lets users search:
 by postcode or accreditation number for an energy assessor by postcode or certificate reference for 3 types of energy certificate, including the energy performance certificate (EPC)  Previously, if someone wanted to find an EPC they had to use the EPC register, a more complicated service that testing showed users find difficult.</description>

      <description>Upcoming areas of investigation We will be meeting with representatives of the Building Safety Programme to discuss relevant areas of investigation.
Timeline December 2018
We met with the team from the Building Safety Programme to demonstrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far around developer contributions and brownfield sites.</description>

      <description>Current areas of investigation The following areas of investigation explore how the data could be used and made easier to work with:
In progress Collecting and publishing housing numbers  Questions we&amp;rsquo;re asking What is the best way to collect and publish data from local plans?
What we&amp;rsquo;re testing We’re focussing on one piece of data from local plans. We’ve now collected the housing numbers from most local plans, and are testing a tool to help us publish this data.</description>

      <description>Current areas of investigation The following areas of investigation explore how the data could be used and made easier to work with:
In progress What needs are we trying to address through opening up local plan data?  Questions we’re asking To identify what data we want to make usable in local plans, we need to first understand who local plans are for and what people need from them.</description>

      <title>Single register of planning</title>
      <link>https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/</guid>
      <description>Goals Our goals for this project are to:
 Prototype: Prototype how to make planning applications available as a collection of data in order to show how a beta system with more complete data could work. Inspire: Create, or support the creation of, experimental prototypes of what can be done with this data, in order to demonstrate the potential value of making an open index of this data. Plan for scale: Explore options for how to scale from a prototype to a production system, and the challenges that would need to be addressed, in order to show how to turn this into a sustainable solution.</description>

      <title>Unused properties</title>

      <description>We’re working with the Cities and Local Growth unit at MHCLG to investigate the best way to collect and publish data on unused properties. This project is part of Our plan for the high street: Budget 2018 brief, which states that “the government will trial a register of empty commercial properties to help prospective retailers to find empty properties and help local stakeholders tackle fragmented ownership on their high street.”</description>
