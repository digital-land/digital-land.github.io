<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-making">local plan</a> sets out all local planning policies and decisions for authorities. It identifies how land is used, decides what will be built where and is used to determine all local planning decisions. Every local planning authority is required to update its local plan every 5 years.</p>

<p>Local plans are a rich source of information, but the data used to produce that information isn’t easily extracted. For example, a local plan might show a map of where housing will be built, but the data that made the map (such as addresses and coordinates) is not available.</p>

<p>Local plans are published in a wide range of formats and aren’t always consistent in what types of information they include, or how they define or represent that information. This makes it difficult to collect, use and compare data across local plans and difficult for machines to read the data.</p>

<p><strong>July 2020</strong></p>

<p>The Digital Land team began the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/beta/">beta phase</a>.</p>

<p><strong>May 2020: week 6 of alpha</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> completed the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/alpha/">alpha phase</a>, designing a <a href="https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3">third prototype which pulls together all the work</a>, including <a href="https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3/publish-data">written guidance to help local authorities publish their local plan data</a>. The team also wrote up an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRQAXERMxFtnHperwzobOKVbOofG5SXwurb31AJZzOx5c7k1ObsBinNBuZ9uc1Ifw/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">end of project report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>May 2020: <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2020-05-07/">week 5 of alpha</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> tested the <a href="https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v2">national picture prototype</a> with MHCLG policy colleagues, and wrote up <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/alpha/#user-needs">additional user needs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>May 2020: <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2020-05-01/">week 4 of alpha</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> designed the <a href="https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v2">second alpha prototype</a>, showing a national picture for plan making, along with the underlying data standard/schema to support this. They then tested the prototype with 3 people from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">Planning Inspectorate</a>, as well as researching with colleagues at MHCLG responsible for housing delivery and supply.</p>

<p><strong>April 2020: <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2020-04-24/">week 3 of alpha</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> sent a survey to a group of local authorities to get insights into how local plans are structured. The team also mapped out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)</a> to better understand what is already required in local plans.</p>

<p><strong>April 2020: <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2020-04-17/">week 2 of alpha</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> designed the <a href="https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v1">first prototype</a> and tested it with 3 local authorities.</p>

<p><strong>April 2020: <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/2020-04-10/">week 1 of alpha</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> ran a domain mapping workshop to explore the relationships between points of data in the plan making process.</p>

<p><strong>March 2020</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw</a> were awarded the 6-week alpha project, working alongside the <a href="https://local.gov.uk/pas">Planning Advisory Service (PAS)</a> and MHCLG.</p>

<p><strong>January 2020</strong></p>

<p>We opened a supplier opportunity through <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/11591">Digital Marketplace</a> for the local plans alpha phase.</p>

<p><strong>Late July 2019</strong></p>

<p>We presented our findings and agreed next steps with the planning directorate steering group.</p>

<p><strong>Mid July 2019</strong></p>

<p>We ran workshops internally with the Local Digital team and stakeholders to share results and plan for alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Late June 2019</strong></p>

<p>We completed a full analysis of discovery findings, ID user traits, pain points and user needs. We also created hypotheses for moving into alpha (or breaking the project down into several different alphas).</p>

<p><strong>Early June 2019</strong></p>

<p>We completed interviews with 9 local authorities across England who are at various stages in their plan making process. We also completed interviews with neighbourhood planning experts to understand the use of local plans after they have been adopted.</p>

<p><strong>24 May 2019</strong></p>

<p>We ran a workshop with the housing policy team to learn about how they use local plans.</p>

<p><strong>March - May 2019</strong></p>

<p>We are meeting with local authorities across the country to understand the different Local Plan making processes, the challenges faced by those involved, and the data used throughout the process. This is a key part of our research into how digital tools could support the process of collecting and publishing data, and making local plans.</p>

<p><strong>24 April 2019</strong></p>

<p>We met with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">Planning Inspectorate</a> to learn about their involvement in monitoring emerging plans.</p>

<p><strong>April 2019</strong></p>

<p>We met with 2 councils in April to learn about their plan-making process.</p>

<p><strong>28 February 2019</strong></p>

<p>We ran a workshop with the planning policy team to learn about their needs around creating, monitoring and reviewing local plans.</p>

<p><strong>February 2019</strong></p>

<p>We started the discovery phase.</p>

<p><strong>10 January 2019</strong></p>

<p>We attended the ‘Answering the Housing Land Question - Building a Knowledge Base’ conference in Reading and participated in a panel on ‘Land: The State of Data and Information Availability’.</p>
