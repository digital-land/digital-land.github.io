<h3 id="this-week-at-digital-land">This week at Digital Land</h3>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 28 June 2019</p>

<p>It’s been an exciting week! On Tuesday we found out that the Find an Energy Certificate or Assessor alpha, which Jake and Emily worked on, has passed the GDS assessment and can move onto beta.</p>

<p>Another exciting milestone is that the updates to our Digital Land website are live. Michael has been writing the new content for the website, working on our team vision, mission statement, about us and user pages. He’s also been working with Helena to update the local plans project page. Michael, Emily and Jake have been updating the website over the last few weeks and demoed the new site to the team on Thursday. Everyone decided the updates were ready to go live and we’re all really pleased with the results.</p>

<p>This week the <a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/">Local Digital Collaboration Unit (LDCU)</a> had a visit from Lincoln Council senior management team. Rebecca joined them to talk about her experiences of introducing agile ways of working into an organisation that hasn&rsquo;t worked in that way before.</p>

<p>Rebecca has also been working on introducing communities of practice into MHCLG Digital, preparing for a session at the upcoming MHCLG Digital annual away day, plus also working with the delivery manager community to develop what we see as the delivery manager role in this context.</p>

<p>Paul D has been continuing to analyse the current brownfield site registers, but mostly helping to frame our work for the spend review. He enjoyed hearing from Connected Places Catapult on their recent discovery into data standards for PlanTech, and reading the <a href="https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/using-housing-data-for-good-if-and-homes-england/">If discovery report for Homes England</a> on using housing data for good.</p>

<p>Ed attended the MasterMap steering group that aims to open up <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/open-mastermap.html">geospatial data</a>. The group expressed confidence about delivery of the programme. He also prepared an internal status update on our work which accompanied Paul D&rsquo;s presentation at the Digital Planning and Housing steering group.</p>

<p>Natalie and Ed met with MHCLG colleagues working on the Beyond Whitehall Project to discuss how digital practices can be incorporated into the policy profession. Natalie has also been working on spending review documents and working with policy teams in the department. She went to a roundtable at Geovation with Jess and met PropTech startups, and also participated in a workshop regarding the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.</p>

<p>Christine has been working on a new prototype for the register editing tool, including a database to store draft entries. Colm has added his great new frontend work to the repo too.</p>

<p>Jake has been iterating the <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/validator-serverless">brownfield sites validator</a> for the <a href="https://brownfield-sites-status.herokuapp.com">brownfield sites status page</a> that Adam and Colm have built. The validator runs nightly to check the brownfield site registers that local authorities publish.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 21 June 2019</p>

<p>This week in the Digital Land team, Adam, Colm and Jake have been working on the brownfield sites validator. Paul D has also been looking at the data published in brownfield registers to help design a <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-sites-report">simpler format</a>. He also held a fireside chat with Emma Williamson of Haringey at the <a href="https://nd19.co.uk/agenda-2019">digileaders event</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/48098128567/in/datetaken-ff/" title="Paul chatting with Emma"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48098128567_391ff0d4ae_z_d.jpg" width="540" height="370" alt="Paul chatting with Emma"></a></p>

<p>Colm has also been working on Digital Land Front-end, creating component macros and converting templates into Jinja templating language, so they can be used with Flask applications.</p>

<p>Christine has been part of a week long hackathon with members of other digital teams. They have been joined by consultants from Microsoft to look into using topic modeling technologies to investigate which topics MHCLG are discussing the most with Local Authorities.</p>

<p>Matt met with the Planning Caseworker team in Birmingham to understand more about the systems that they use to manage CPOs (Compulsory Purchase Orders). There are 2 systems: Planet and Horizon. It was useful to see the data they collect and gain some ideas about how we can extract the data which we’ll be testing over the next few days. He also attended the Greater London Authority show and tell for their alpha funded LDCU project. In addition, along with Rebecca and Colm, he worked on creating a draft of the OKRs for the team which will soon be available on the website.</p>

<p>Rebecca also facilitated a retro for the local digital collaboration unit, as well as helping to arrange the joint internal showcase with the local digital collaboration unit. Michael has been reviewing comments on the first draft of the Local Plans project page. He has also completed a draft text on the team vision and mission statement, which is now ready for review.</p>

<p>In the policy end of the team, Natalie has been providing digital policy support to housing and planning colleagues across the department this week for a number of projects, as well as looking at financial planning for future projects. Jess has been finalising the PropTech strategy report and setting out recommendations for future engagement. Finally, Ed’s blog post called <a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/18/lessons-we-learned-at-the-future-proptech-exhibition/">Lessons we learned at the Future PropTech exhibition</a> went live on the MHCLG Digital blog page this week.</p>

<p>This week, we spent Tuesday and Wednesday together at our Team Away days. We kicked off with a team retrospective, which led to discussions around building further relationships with policy teams and how to improve the delivery of products we&rsquo;re working on. We also went to the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/events/imaginary-cities">Imaginary Cities exhibition at the British Library</a> and were joined by Lorna, our new user researcher.</p>

<p>Rebecca met with policy teams to talk about how we capture policy needs in our team planning, and met with Cities and Local Growth (CLOG) team to action things from last weeks <a href="https://medium.com/oneteamgov/one-team-gov-wellbeing-camp-411c409946df">One Team Gov wellbeing camp</a>.</p>

<p>Jake and Emily spent the week preparing for and attended the Energy Performance of Buildings alpha assessment with the Digital Delivery team.</p>

<p>Christine has been working out the next steps for the register tools with Adam, Matt and Colm.</p>

<p>Matt wrote a draft offer document for empty buildings project, and met with Campaign to Protect Rural England to discuss their needs around brownfield land data.</p>

<p>Rebecca and Ed also attended Christine&rsquo;s weekly code club, focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Classes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">Methods</a>.</p>

<h4 id="local-plans">Local plans</h4>

<p>This week, Paul (Bermudez) and Helena have been busy working on the tail end of the <a href="/project/local-plans">Local Plans discovery</a>. Their primary focus has been to analyse the insights that they&rsquo;ve gathered so far ahead of an internal steering group next week.</p>

<p>On another aspect of Local Plans, the <a href="/project/housing-numbers">housing numbers</a>, our colleagues on the policy team have collected housing numbers from local plans. The vast majority of Local Planning Authorities have now been accounted for, and Colm and Adam are helping to make some changes to how we capture data for joint plans.</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h4 id="developer-contributions">Developer contributions</h4>

<p>Following the developer contributions workshops and lab testing the team have been analysing the feedback to identify areas where we can make improvements. Emily and Michael have made a number of <a href="/guidance/developer-contributions">changes to the guidance</a> which we hope will address some of the problem areas that we identified.</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<p>This week Paul had his first MHCLG Digital Land birthday! It was a good moment to reflect on what we&rsquo;ve done so far and where we&rsquo;re heading over the next year.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One year at <a href="https://twitter.com/mhclg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mhclg</a>, think we&#39;ve found a feasible approach to tackle a massive issue, everyone here is lovely, helped recruit some great people it&#39;s a pleasure to work with, and am still learning.</p>&mdash; Paul Downey (@psd) <a href="https://twitter.com/psd/status/1095969748876173312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The team have been working on a <a href="https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/">tool to help collect housing numbers data</a> from within Local Plans. We&rsquo;re working with colleagues in the policy team to identify the correct housing numbers and store them in one place.</p>

<p>Helena and Paul B attended the Future Cities Catapult’s (FCC) workshop about better data in planning, to see the work FCC have done so far and advise on the pros/cons of several options to improve data use in planning going forwards. Helena also presented the vision and work so far of our team at the London LDCU roadshow.</p>

<p>Paul D attended the ‘Big data and the design of cities - Chicago and London’ event at New London Architecture, to talk about how the collection and dissemination of big data is changing how we plan and build cities, and about the future of open data collection and use.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01 February 2019</p>

<p>This week the Digital Land Service and the Planning Infrastructure policy team ran 3 workshops with local planning authority representatives focusing on <a href="https://digital-land-github.io/project/developer-contributions">developer contributions</a>. The public consultation on developer contributions has just closed, but we’ll be continuing to seek input from all stakeholders through forums like these as well as other channels.</p>

<p>Held in London, Leeds and Birmingham, the workshops helped the Digital Land team better understand how planning authorities manage developer contributions, what challenges they face and what opportunities they can see in opening up developer contribution data. We were also able to test the proposed data standard for developer contributions as well as our prototyped tools and guidance.</p>

<p>We gained a lot of insights from the workshops that will help us iterate the data standard, tools and guidance so that they ultimately improve the quality of data while adding as little as possible to authorities’ workload.</p>

We are also preparing for two user research workshops on <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/">local plans</a>, one with internal MHCLG policy users and one with external users, to better understand the user needs and problems that need to be solved.</p>

<p>Emily from <a href="https://mysociety.org">MySociety</a> hotdesked with our team on Monday, and will be doing so one day a week from now on. She’s written a <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/kicking-off-the-planning-permissions-project/">blog post</a> about the project kickoff for the <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2019/01/14/an-examination-of-the-aggregation-of-planning-application-information/">central register of planning applications</a> project.</p>

<p>We’re keen to have MySociety - and others we are working with - participate in our fortnightly show and tells, and will making this happen more regularly in the coming months. We are talking to a lot of external stakeholders at the moment about how we can work together. This week we met with <a href="https://www.arup.com/">Arup</a> and with the CEO and Chairman of <a href="https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/">New London Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>The team’s work on <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions">developer contributions</a> is progressing. Three workshops we have just announced over subscribed within 24 hours! We look forward to meeting with local authority planners at those workshops at the end of January.</p>

<p>We had a great conversation with Max in the local plans team and have started building the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans">project page</a> which describes our work.</p>

<p>We have been talking to colleagues in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport">Department for Transport</a> about how our work areas are linked and we attended a joint show and tell with them on Thursday.</p>

<p>This week the developer contributions <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developer-contributions-reform-technical-consultation">public consultation</a> went live. We don’t anticipate a huge flurry of activity over the holiday period, but we have already seen some comments and questions being added to the our <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">GitHub issues</a> – we’ll be monitoring these closely and keeping the conversation going.</p>

<p>Also related to developer contributions, we visited Mid Suffolk and Babergh to talk with them about the data format we are proposing. It was very useful to hear how they are currently managing their Section 106 and CIL agreements, and are committed to making everything as open and transparent as possible. Also in the meeting were Exacom, one of the 3rd parties who specialise in developer contributions, we’re working with them to test whether it’s possible to get an extract of data from Exacom that meets our data format. We hope to progress this over the Christmas period.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week Paul and Rebecca headed to <a href="https://www.brent.gov.uk/">Brent Council</a> to start some user research into the needs of data from local plans. On the back of this visit we’re going to be looking at their FOIs for local plan information, this will help give us an indication of which data we may need to prioritise.</p>

<p>On Thursday the team held our design crit at <a href="https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/">New London Architecture</a>, here we also took the opportunity to see the <a href="https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/about/new-london-model/new-london-model">New London Model exhibition</a>.

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 14 December 2018</p>

<p>In advance of the public consultation for developer contributions the team have been thinking about how we’ll manage questions and feedback in an open and transparent fashion. We’ve decided to try using <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues">GitHub issues</a> – it provides us with a place where we can document all our feedback, have conversations in the open, and record any design decisions that are made. We haven’t publicised this approach, but we’re already getting feedback from <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues/21">members of the community</a> about what we’re doing.</p>

<p>Having worked through a couple of projects we’re getting a better understanding of what the architecture for the services we’ll be taking into beta will look like. We had a <a href="https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues/38">whiteboard session to try and draw this out</a> and will turn this into a more articulate vision on our website.</p>

<p>This week we also had the whole team was in the same location at the same time! We used this as an opportunity to do a bit of a retrospective, a ways of working exercise, and talk about what we’re planning to do over the next few months.</p>

<p>On Tuesday Paul joined a panel at the ODI summit to talk about how local governments can take advantage of the opportunities created by data to improve public services and better serve communities.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/propject/developer-contributions">developer contributions</a> project we met with the GLA, Southwark and TFL to discuss the user needs and data model. It was encouraging to hear that we’re all on the same page with regards to the data we’d like to publish. We also talked through some of the challenges that we’ve identified, and agreed some useful next steps to work on these collaboratively.</p>

<p>We’ve started prototyping a <a href="https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/developer-contributions/section106-wide">dashboard of the developer contribution data</a>, at the moment it uses some test data, we’ll be feeding in some real data over the course of the next few weeks.</p>

<p>This week the team focused on two area:</p>

<h4 id="brownfield-sites">Brownfield sites</h4>

<p>Michael has been updating the guidance on brownfield sites. He has a draft of the proposed content and the next step is to review with the brownfield policy team before replacing the existing guidance on GOV.UK. We hope that with clearer guidance, and being about to point to the validator tool the revised registers will be of improved quality once they’re updated in the new year.</p>

<h4 id="developer-contributions-1">Developer Contributions.</h4>

<p>Building on the user needs work that we did last week we’ve now been able to put together a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/45138775504/">proposed data specification</a>. This is much simpler than what was proposed at the start of the project, and we hope that it’ll be easy for planning authorities to maintain. Today we talked through the data model with Southwark, they provided some useful feedback that we’ll incorporate. Over the next few weeks we’ll be testing the spec with a number of planning authorities to understand how it works.</p>

<p>This week we continued further work on the brownfield site validator. You can now see a side-by-side comparison of some of the common errors (ie reversed GeoX and GeoY coordinates). For a number of the common errors we can automatically fix these, and provide the local authority with a valid .csv file that they can re-upload to their site.</p>

<p>We met with the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/">Greater London Authority</a> (GLA) at City Hall. We talked about data standards and how that fits into their London Development Database initiative. Through the meeting with identified a number of areas of common interest, for example establishing a data standard around developer contributions, over the coming weeks we plan to hold join workshops between planning authorities, the GLA and MHCLG.</p>

<p>The team has been working on the <a href="https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/">brownfield sites validator</a> iterating the data model so we can understand the history of changes to registers. Of the 381 registers we have found 339 published, only 20 meet the standard, 5 with no errors. Over the course of the past two months, 32 have been moved or gone missing. We’re working on better guidance and tools to help publishers meet the standard.</p>

<p>We also had a quick show-and-tell with the implementation unit before talking about the golden thread recommendation from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report">Hackitt review</a>.</p>

<h3 id="this-week-at-digital-land-services-18">This week at Digital Land Services</h3>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 28 September 2018</p>

<p>Over the past week the team have been looking at the following things:</p>

<h4 id="section-106-and-viability-assessments">Section 106 and Viability Assessments</h4>

<p>We’ve been working closely with the Planning Policy Team and Local Planning Authorities to understand their needs around Section 106 and Viability Assessment data. We’ve learnt that although the NPPF encourages Local Authorities to publish this information the appetite to do so varies between each authority.</p>

<p>To help us learn more about what is needed we’ve built a <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/#current-areas-of-investigation">couple of prototypes</a> that collects and publishes the pertinent information. Our next step is to test this with Local Authorities.</p>

<h4 id="brownfield-site-validator">Brownfield Site Validator</h4>

<p>We’ve picked up on <a href="https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/">Brownfield Site Validator</a> from a few months ago and added some enhancements to summarise the errors and warnings that have been found on each data set. Over the next week we’ll continue to work on this, and look at how we can automatically apply any quick fixes to improve the data set.</p>

<h4 id="document-our-findings">Document our findings</h4>

<p>We’ve begun to <a href="https://digital-land.github.io">document our findings</a>, this includes learnings from discovery as well as some of the tools we’ve been taking into alpha. We’ll continue to create more content on the site, and build a homepage that describes what the team is doing</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 3 August 2018</p>

<p>This week the team continued working on <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/">Section 106</a>. We met with <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/">Southwark Council</a> who told us about the work their team are doing around collecting and publishing Section 106 data.</p>

<p>We’ve also started to build an <a href="https://section-106-prototype.cloudapps.digital/create-section106">online form</a> to collect Section 106 summary and Viability Assessment summary data. We’ll use this to help test the data standard with Local Planning Authorities.</p>

<h3 id="this-week-at-digital-land-services-20">This week at Digital Land Services</h3>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27 July 2019</p>

<p>This week the Digital Land Services team ran their first show and tell where we talked about some of our findings from discovery, and demoed an early view of the ‘brownfield sites validator’ tool. We plan to run future show and tells on a fortnightly basis, and hope to be able to make them publicly available soon.</p>

<p>We continued development work on the <a href="https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/">‘brownfield sites validator’</a> which now feeds back whether a given set of data meets the specification, and if not where the problems are. Our next step is to provide a visual representation of the data on a map.</p>

<p>The team also had a rare opportunity to be co-located for a few days, we used this time to run some design sessions, and conduct an end of discovery retrospective.</p>

<p>We were joined this week by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlucht">Matt Lucht</a>, our new delivery manager, Michael Nottingham, our new part-time content editor and by <a href="https://twitter.com/blangry">Alex Blandford</a>, a user researcher working for Rose. We’ve begun to write-up our discovery findings which we plan to present on the 28th and publish publicly on our new blog shortly afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="this-week-at-digital-land-services-22">This week at Digital Land Services</h3>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 8 June 2018</p>

<p>Rose has been recruiting participants to give us insight into how the brownfield registers were made, and if they are working for users. We were joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/blangry">Alex Blandford</a>, who has been helping us start our end-of-discovery report.</p>

<p>We rebuilt our <a href="https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-collector">data collector</a> and started to collect tree preservation orders and contaminated land datasets published by planning authorities. So far this has meant sending out 120 emails, many of which we learnt, arrived in the inbox of one person working at <a href="https://misoportal.com/">Misoportal</a></p>

<p>Next week we’re joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattlucht">Matt Lucht</a>, our new delivery manager and later in the week, by Michael Nottingham, our content editor.</p>
