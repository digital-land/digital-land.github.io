      <description>mySociety is working with MHCLG on a Discovery and Alpha project to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.
Our Single register of planning project began as a response to a commitment made in the Autumn 2017 budget to create a register of planning permissions across all planning authorities in England and Wales:
 The government will develop a central register of residential planning permissions from local authorities to improve information on where permissions are held and progress towards them being built out.</description>

      <description>mySociety is working with MHCLG on a Discovery and Alpha project to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.
We’ve spent the first six weeks of this project getting to grips with the domain of planning applications. We started by looking at what other people and organisations have done in this area already and then moved on to talking to as many people as we could, with an aim of exploring a number of different topics:</description>

      <description>mySociety is working with MHCLG on a Discovery and Alpha project to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.
One of the things we were struck by as we started this project was by how much work has already happened in this area. So, we thought it might be useful to document some of this history, for anyone else who might travel this way in future.</description>

      <description>Headlines  Wrapping up the Discovery phase user research interviews and analysing the findings.  Last sprint we…  Talked to OpenAustralia about their PlanningAlerts project, as well as the folks at PlanningPortal and the PlanX team. Went to the Show &amp;amp; Tell by Southwark Council / Unboxed about their 8-week project to build a back-office planning system. Conducted a further 10 user research interviews!  This sprint we will…  Present our Discovery phase findings at a session with the Digital Land team.</description>

      <description>Headlines  Creating and validating a basic model of planning applications, with information and insights from our Discovery phase user research interviews thus far.  Last sprint we…  Kicked off the project! See this blog post. Created a draft roadmap for the Discovery and Alpha phases of this work. Arranged and held 7+ stakeholder and user research interviews to find out more about the lifecycle of a planning application, the data links around planning applications and permissions, the schema that existing planning application/permissions viewing tools have, what kinds of people make use of planning applications/permissions data, and how a central government data source might be able to help them.</description>

      <description>The Digital Land team at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) is working to make it easier for people to find, access and trust the data underlying England’s housing market.
Access to reliable data on where planning permissions have been granted, rejected and built out is an important part of this work. That’s where the mySociety team come in – we are collaborating on a Discovery and Alpha project, to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.</description>

      <description>These projects work towards better local plans, which are huge, costly undertakings faced by all planning authorities. Local plans have a wide range of users, including developers of all sizes and the planning authorities themselves. So everyone would benefit if these were easier to create and easier to use.</description>

      <description>Land located close to airports and flight paths may be subject to aircraft noise. This noise is classified in 3 ways:
 mechanical noise — rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds aerodynamic noise — from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds noise from aircraft systems — cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units  The Aviation Policy Framework outlines planning considerations with regards to aircraft noise</description>

      <description>Often there is no direct download for the data, but rather an email contact, who in many cases must be emailed separately for each requested dataset. This was the case when we tried to compile a national database of tree preservation orders. Of the 80 datasets listed on data.gov.uk, 31 were behind an email gateway operated by misoportal.com.
Many users fear data you have to request cannot then be presented in services, even when it’s licensed as open data:</description>

      <description>Are often on disused or derelict land. Are more available in the North and Midlands (but most housing demand is in the south east). Are valuable as existing buildings can be split up into more homes on any one site. The site has already been developed so reduces urban sprawl. Use unsightly areas for building developments, so improves the urban environment. Are found in urban areas, so building housing there reduces demand on car use.</description>

      <description>Brownfield sites are plots of land that have previously been developed but are not currently in use. Recent analysis suggests more than 1 million houses could be built on brownfield sites across England.
The Digital Land team is working with local planning authorities to improve the quality and availability of data on brownfield sites across England. We&amp;rsquo;ve created resources to help local planning authorities publish and update their brownfield site data.</description>

      <description>A compulsory purchase order (CPO) is a tool that can be used by certain bodies to authorise the acquisition of land and property. Its use can help make possible a wide range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects, where there is a compelling case in the public interest.
The Secretary of State is responsible for taking decisions on the approval of CPOs. There is currently no central, publicly accessible register of these decisions or how they were arrived at.</description>

      <description>It’s often hard to write an automatic process to download a dataset:
 URLs change or break Some data is made using JavaScript which only works when a human is present Many datasets are kept behind email or permissions-walls  These barriers mean collecting and updating datasets published by organisations including Ordnance Survey, Environment Agency, Historic England and many local authorities is a manual process.</description>

      <description>Data needed is seldom found online, with many datasets held locally and in widely varying formats.
Local plans are often locked inside PDF documents, for example, which means the values can’t be extracted automatically. This is particularly difficult for geospatial data, where conservation and other areas are presented as images.
Even where there are regional or national repositories of data, these typically do not link to the actual data, but often rather to an authority or other data publisher’s homepage or to a dead link.</description>

      <description>Much of the data is compiled in raw form, but only published by government in the form of statistics.
Local plan making involves commissioning a lot of data, but that evidence is often unavailable with the local plan, but later challenged during the planning appeals process.
Raw data has more use-cases than statistics, so limiting access to raw data is in effect limiting the development of innovative products for the housing marketplace.</description>

      <description>Often even the most basic information often isn’t available as data. For example, every local planning authority should publish a local plan, but there isn’t an authoritative list of local planning authorities, and there isn’t a single list of local plans.
The best public list of local planning authorities we’ve found is a PDF published by the planning inspectorate, but the data in this is text, which requires effort and care to process.</description>

      <description>Much data is made available under an open government licence, but with additional, restrictive terms.
National radon data, for example, commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive is made available “for planning purposes only” and one brownfield register publisher explicitly warns against building services which compete with Ordnance Survey.
Such restrictions limit unforseen, innovative use-cases for the data.</description>

      <description>Help us develop a common data format In the alpha phase of this project, we developed a new common standard for publishing data on developer contributions.
We are proposing a simple data format for developer contributions that:
 meets the user needs we’ve identified requires minimal effort from local planning authorities to create and make the data available  You can help us improve the format by:
 joining the discussion on our GitHub issues making comments using our feedback form following the proposed guidance next time you publish your developer contributions  We will continue to develop the format as we learn from testing the format with data and the prototypes with users.</description>

      <description>Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are needed whenever a property is:
 built sold rented  You must order an EPC for potential buyers and tenants before you market your property to sell or rent.
An EPC contains:
 information about a property’s energy use and typical energy costs recommendations about how to reduce energy use and save money  An EPC gives a property an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient) and is valid for 10 years.</description>

      <description>In the 2018 Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety there is a recommendation to keep a &amp;lsquo;digital record&amp;rsquo; of information on residential buildings that have 10 or more storeys. Its purpose is to make accurate building information available to those responsible for assessing and demonstrating the safety of buildings.
The Digital Land team and policy teams at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are working with the Building Safety Programme to understand what a &amp;lsquo;digital record&amp;rsquo; might look like, and how the data could be collected and made available.</description>

      <description>As part of our wider project on local plans, we’re collecting and publishing the number of houses each local authority has committed to build. Focussing on just one piece of data will help us to learn how local plans are structured, what challenges there are around collecting data, and how to prioritise the wider local plans project.
We hope that by publishing these numbers in one place, local authorities can easily check and update their data, and other people who are interested can easily find, trust and use the data.</description>

However many organisations see publishing data is seen as a burden, an externality, with little return on the costs of publication.</description>

      <description>Local development schemes are public &amp;lsquo;project plans&amp;rsquo; which identify which local development documents will be produced, in what order and when. It became a statutory requirement for local planning authorities in the UK to produce these schemes under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.
The local development scheme acts as the starting point for the community and stakeholders to find out about the local authority&amp;rsquo;s planning policies in respect to a particular place or issue, and what the status of those policies is.</description>

      <description>Local plans set out local planning policies, identify how land is used, and decide what will be built where. They are a rich source of information, but the equally useful data used to produce them isn’t easily extracted. For example, a local plan might show a map of where housing will be built, but the data that made the map (such as addresses and coordinates) is not made available.</description>

      <description>The net development value is the estimated amount of money that a property development expects to make once all costs (land value, development, marketing etc) and sales have been taken into consideration.
As a part of the viability assessment a third party may work with a property developer and local authority to ensure that estimates reflect current market values.</description>

      <description>The National Planning Policy Framework requires all local planning authorities and certain other organisations to publish their developer contributions data on a regular basis and in an agreed format. That format hasn’t yet been agreed, but the following guidance is a working approach that we plan to refine with your input.
Our aim is to develop a data format and publishing guidance that results in better insights into how developer contributions are supporting community infrastructure.</description>

 Prototype: Prototype how to make planning applications available as a collection of data in order to show how a beta system with more complete data could work. Inspire: Create, or support the creation of, experimental prototypes of what can be done with this data, in order to demonstrate the potential value of making an open index of this data. Plan for scale: Explore options for how to scale from a prototype to a production system, and the challenges that would need to be addressed, in order to show how to turn this into a sustainable solution.</description>

      <description>A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a formal conservation designation for an area which is of particular interest because of its fauna, flora or geological or physiological features.
Local authorities are required to have policies within their local plan to protect SSSIs, and should a planning application be submitted either on or close to the site then the appropriate conversation body must be consulted.

      <guid>https://digital-land.github.io/friction/data-is-inconsistent-across-publishers/</guid>
      <description>Often the same specific types of data are defined or formatted differently depending on the publisher. This inconsistency exists even where a standard is in place.
For example, among the 330 lists made available to meet the brownfield register standard we found 31 different file formats and a wide range of character encoding, blank lines, blank column names, incorrect formatting, incompatibility and other useability issues.
This widespread inconsistency across publishers is problematic for anyone developing data-based products that serve the housing market nationwide.</description>

 cutting down topping lopping uprooting wilful damage wilful destruction  of trees without the local planning authority’s written consent. If consent is given, it can be subject to conditions which have to be followed. In the Secretary of State’s view, cutting roots is also a prohibited activity and requires the authority’s consent.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to determine what data is needed to make a better planning application. We have asked local authorities for their lists of constraints, but often these are general concerns (e.g. “Gas”) rather than a more precise reference to an authoritative source of information.
It would be difficult to create a service that knows which authority to send a planning application to, let alone which pieces of data are needed to create a strong planning application.</description>
