      <description>mySociety is working with MHCLG on a Discovery and Alpha project to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.
Our Single register of planning project began as a response to a commitment made in the Autumn 2017 budget to create a register of planning permissions across all planning authorities in England and Wales:
 The government will develop a central register of residential planning permissions from local authorities to improve information on where permissions are held and progress towards them being built out.</description>

      <description>mySociety is working with MHCLG on a Discovery and Alpha project to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.
We’ve spent the first six weeks of this project getting to grips with the domain of planning applications. We started by looking at what other people and organisations have done in this area already and then moved on to talking to as many people as we could, with an aim of exploring a number of different topics:</description>

One of the things we were struck by as we started this project was by how much work has already happened in this area. So, we thought it might be useful to document some of this history, for anyone else who might travel this way in future.</description>

      <description>Headlines  Wrapping up the Discovery phase user research interviews and analysing the findings.  Last sprint we…  Talked to OpenAustralia about their PlanningAlerts project, as well as the folks at PlanningPortal and the PlanX team. Went to the Show &amp;amp; Tell by Southwark Council / Unboxed about their 8-week project to build a back-office planning system. Conducted a further 10 user research interviews!  This sprint we will…  Present our Discovery phase findings at a session with the Digital Land team.</description>

      <description>Headlines  Creating and validating a basic model of planning applications, with information and insights from our Discovery phase user research interviews thus far.  Last sprint we…  Kicked off the project! See this blog post. Created a draft roadmap for the Discovery and Alpha phases of this work. Arranged and held 7+ stakeholder and user research interviews to find out more about the lifecycle of a planning application, the data links around planning applications and permissions, the schema that existing planning application/permissions viewing tools have, what kinds of people make use of planning applications/permissions data, and how a central government data source might be able to help them.</description>

      <description>The Digital Land team at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) is working to make it easier for people to find, access and trust the data underlying England’s housing market.
Access to reliable data on where planning permissions have been granted, rejected and built out is an important part of this work. That’s where the mySociety team come in – we are collaborating on a Discovery and Alpha project, to research, prototype, and test ways to make data around planning applications more open, accessible, sustainable, and trustworthy.</description>
